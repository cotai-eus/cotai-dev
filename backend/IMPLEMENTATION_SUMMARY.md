## Deployment Steps

1. **Run Database Migration**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   alembic upgrade head
   ```

2. **Seed Initial Data (Optional)**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python scripts/seed_quotation_data.py
   ```

3. **Register the API Router** (Already done)
   The quotation API router is registered in the main application.

4. **Test the API**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   pytest tests/services/test_price_suggestion.py
   pytest tests/services/test_risk_analysis.py
   pytest tests/api/test_quotation.py
   ```
